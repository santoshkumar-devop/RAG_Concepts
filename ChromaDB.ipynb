    "Understanding Conversational Memory in RAG\n",
    "Conversational memory enables RAG systems to maintain context across multiple interactions. This is crucial for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow-up questions that reference previous answers\n",
    "Pronoun resolution (e.g., \"it\", \"they\", \"that\")\n",
    "Context-dependent queries that build on prior discussion\n",
    "Natural dialogue flow where users don't repeat context\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Challenge:\n",
    "Traditional RAG retrieves documents based only on the current query, missing important context from the conversation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"Tell me about Python\"\n",
    "Bot: explains Python programming language\n",
    "User: \"What are its main libraries?\" ← \"its\" refers to Python, but retriever doesn't know this\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "The modern approach uses a two-step process:\n",

    "Query Reformulation: Transform context-dependent questions into standalone queries\n",
    "Context-Aware Retrieval: Use the reformulated query to fetch relevant documents\n",
